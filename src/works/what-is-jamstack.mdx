# The JAM

JAMstack stands for Javascript, APIs, and Markup.

**_Javascript_** handles the dynamic functionalities. You can use plain javascript or any framework you want.

**_APIs_**, the actions that you typically handle on a backend server are now abstracted into reusable APIs, accessed over HTTPS with Javascript.

**_Markup_**, static HTML files. This is prebuilt at build time, usually using a Static Site Generator.

# When is your site/app _not_ built with the Jamstack?

Sites or apps that relies on a tight coupling between client and server like WordPress, Drupal, Joomla, or Squarespace.

In general any app that needs a server to run or it relies on a backend language it's not considered as a JAMstack app.

# Why the Jamstack?

**_Better Performance:_** No database means no time-consuming multiple queries. Static sites are faster sites, even up to 10x, content generate at deploy time.

**_Cheaper, Easier Scaling:_** Hosting those files is cheaper.

**_Higher Security:_** Static websites with no plugins or databases, with the processes abstracted into APIs, areas for attacks are reduced. Plus, more secure site means fewer security expenses.

**_Better Developer Experience:_** More focused development for frontends because we remove the need to maintain a separate stack.

By definition, JAMstack is an alternative approach for building websites. For you, it means faster websites with better SEO ranking capabilities and happier users overall.
