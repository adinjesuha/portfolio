# Project Overview

When _AgroBioTek_ came to me with the task of ​​changing the design of their website, for a cleaner and easier to navigate, I came up with the idea of ​​creating a single page website, without additional pages such as About, Team or Services . All content is located within the same web page, traditionally in a long scroll layout.

Thanks to technologies such as [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), it was possible to transform plain text (Markdown, Liquid, HTML & CSS) into a simple and clean landing page, just as the client requested, without the hassle of setting up free templates and _monolithic_ CMS.

With [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) the website is hosted for free. No more databases, or pesky updates to install—just the content.
