# Project Overview

_Agrobiotek_ offers multiple services and products, ranging from laboratory analysis to trainings for the agroindustry.

That is why they decided to separate their training services and offer to the clients an exclusive platform where they can see the content of each training, register online and request more information or quotes through the platform.

# Gatsby + Netlify and Airtable as Database

[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) as a static site generator that combines the best of React and GraphQL to give you fresh, entirely front-end web building experience.

As for [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), it is an all-in-one tool that provides hosting for static sites with automatic deploys from GitHub, environment variables, **serverless functions** and a lot more.

[Airtable](https://airtable.com/) is another multi-functional tool that has a great visual database system that automatically generates a project-specific API.

# Airtable via Serverless Functions

Serverless functions are the Mitochondria of the web applications — they can be used to perform CRUD operations, access third-party APIs, and many more.
