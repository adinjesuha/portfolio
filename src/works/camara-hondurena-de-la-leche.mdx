# Project Overview

The previous CAHLE site was built on WordPress and was too old, the maintenance over the years became complicated. The idea was clear, replace Wordpress with a modern-day web dev architecture that will be constantly growing.

[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) as a static site generator, [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/) as a headless CMS and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) as a hosting and CI/CD solution.

For me and CAHLE, the benefits (of JAMstack) are straight forward. Cost is an obvious win as well as the ease of implementing enhancements and inherent security improvements.
